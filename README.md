# Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning the pretrained BERT language model found [here](https://huggingface.co/dumitrescustefan/bert-base-romanian-uncased-v1), using a custom dataset. The main task is NER with words from the medical field, using PyTorch.

Also included is a text file which contains the custom data set. It is structred to be similar to the one [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ronec). Currently the dataset is small, but it is constantly being expaned and improved.
